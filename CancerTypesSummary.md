# Cancer Types Summary

## Introduction

The **Cancer Types Summary Tab** is most useful when you are analyzing cancer studies with > 1 cancer type.  For example, the MSK-IMPACT cancer study contains dozens of cancer types, all obtained during routine clinical sequencing.  You can therefore use the Cancer Types Summary tab to directly summarize genomic alterations across multiple cancer types within the MSK-IMPACT study.

For example, you can assess [IDH1 mutations across all cancer types in the MSK-IMPACT cohort](http://bit.ly/2IAkJr4). (Screenshot).

## Options

The Cancer Types Summary tab provides multiple configuration options:

For example, you can easily filter to only show cancer types where IDH1 is altered in >3% of all cases:
